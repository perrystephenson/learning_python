# Learning Python

It had to happen at some point I guess... time to learn Python. These notes will be written specifically for someone that learned C several years ago, smashed around in MATLAB for a bit, currently knows R well enough to do pretty much anything they want to in R, and is learning Bash and Perl at the same time. If this is you, welcome! If not, sorry for the gaps.

## Scripts vs Shell

Python is a language. IPython is an interactive shell (which is itself tautologous, as all shells are interactive, surely?). Python is the name of the language, and there are multiple implementations of Python, including CPython (the reference implementation), PyPy (a faster implemenetation), and more. This is different to R, which is both a language AND an implementation, meaning that the R language is defined by the behaviour of the R interpreter. R runs in both script mode and interactive mode, which is again a key difference. So Python is to R as IPython is to R as CPython is to R. Easy!
